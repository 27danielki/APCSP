		<p>Sophomore year is supposed to be harder than freshman year. I don't really know if this is true. I feel like the work is harder this year but we had more work overall last year.</p>

		<p>A book I enjoy reading is All Quiet on the Western Front. The Book follows a 19 years old German soldier and his commerades who are subject to the terrors of WWI. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the non-allied side of the war.</p>
